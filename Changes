Revision history for Perl module REST::Neo4p

0.4011 DEVELOPMENT
    - Drop dependencies on JSON, JSON::XS, JSON::ize
    - Avoid deprecation warnings for smartmatch on Perl v5.38 and v5.40
    - Fix test suite failing on old Perl versions

0.4010 NOT RELEASED
    - Fix an issue that prevented the use of the Bolt protocol
      with REST::Neo4p via Neo4j::Driver 1.02 or newer
    - Fix an issue that prevented the detection of server errors (GH #28)
    - Avoid deprecation warnings for id() on Neo4j 5 (GH #34)
        - You may find REST::Neo4p to work best on Neo4j 3.5. On older and
          newer versions (Neo4j 1.x through 5.x), it should work as well, but
          certain features may be unavailable. Note that REST::Neo4p currently
          depends on legacy numeric IDs for nodes and relationships, which may
          not be reliably available on future Neo4j versions.

    - when a row contains multiple elements, at least one of which is
